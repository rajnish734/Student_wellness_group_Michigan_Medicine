Calculate summary statistics for heart rates and steps for the student wellness group. 
```{r }
df_SWG_all <- readRDS("df_COMB_SWG_all_20250110_1248.rds")
roadmap_IDs <- read.csv("C:\\Users\\rajnishk\\OneDrive - Michigan Medicine\\Documents\\Analysis_projects_R_laptop\\SWG_R_project\\SWG_data\\StudentWellness_RoadmapID.csv")
dev_IDs <- read.csv("C:\\Users\\rajnishk\\OneDrive - Michigan Medicine\\Documents\\Analysis_projects_R_laptop\\SWG_R_project\\SWG_data\\Device_ID.csv")

```


abcd <- df_SWG_all[df_SWG_all$unique_STEP_CNT>17000,] -- if you try this you will find time instant at where STEPS_MSRMNT_VAL is equal to 17460, but there is no heart rate measurement. So make sure to include the condition that HR_msrd_Y_N == 1 before doing any type of plotting etc. This has been implemented for 

```{r}
roadmap_IDs$onboard_date <- as.Date(roadmap_IDs$onboard_date, format="%m/%d/%y")

```

Creating the summary statistics for heart rate and steps data sets for the group. 
see if the data frame is in Table format.  

```{r}
setDT(df_SWG_all)  
```


```{r}


library(data.table)
library(moments) 

# REMOVE THE FOLLOWING FROM GITHUB

Import MOOD, date of entry with time, along with sleep details for the student wellness group. 

```{r}
df_MOOD_time <- read.csv("C:\\Users\\rajnishk\\OneDrive - Michigan Medicine\\Documents\\Analysis_projects_R_laptop\\SWG_R_project\\SWG_data\\SWG_mood_time_entry.csv")
df_sleep_details<- read.csv("C:\\Users\\rajnishk\\OneDrive - Michigan Medicine\\Documents\\Analysis_projects_R_laptop\\SWG_R_project\\SWG_data\\student_wellness_sleep_details.csv")


```

Just like BMT, let us chekc if the student wellness data set has steps count not equal to zero for sedentary steps type. 


```{r}
prtcpt_stats_4 <- all_participants_SWG_stats[all_participants_SWG_stats$ACTIVITY_TYPE_VAL==4,]
print("there are a few data points that have non zero values of step count for type == 4. Count of these data points are as follows: ")
count(prtcpt_stats_4[prtcpt_stats_4$steps_sum!=0,])

```
I will remove these later in the cleaning process at the minute level, for now, let me just remove those days. 

```{r}
all_participants_SWG_stats_type_4_filtered <- all_participants_SWG_stats %>% 
  filter(!(ACTIVITY_TYPE_VAL == 4 & steps_sum != 0))
```


Let us pivot wide the data frame and add the information about dates of the study days so that we can combine it with mood scores. 


```{r}
HR_STEPS_filtered_stats_SWG_all_ptcpt <- all_participants_SWG_stats_type_4_filtered %>%
  pivot_wider(
    id_cols = c(prtcpt_id, day),
    names_from = ACTIVITY_TYPE_VAL,
    names_glue = "{.value}_type_{ACTIVITY_TYPE_VAL}",
    values_from = c(hr_mean, hr_sd, hr_skewness, hr_kurtosis, 
                   steps_sum, steps_mean, steps_sd, 
                   steps_skewness, steps_kurtosis, n_observations)
  )
```

Add the information about dates from the study days then you can run several regression models just with the physilogical signals first. 

```{r}
# First, let's create a mapping of unique prtcpt_id, day, and date combinations from df_BMT_all
date_mapping <- df_SWG_all[, .(date = as.Date(msmt_instant)[1]), by = .(prtcpt_id, day)]
```

Combine this with dev_IDs and date on each of the dates to get csv file for Xiao. 
```{r}
# steps_20_SWG <- read.csv("C:\\Users\\rajnishk\\OneDrive - Michigan Medicine\\Documents\\Analysis_projects_R_laptop\\SWG_R_project\\SWG_data\\df_step_20.csv")
# # Convert date and create new column
# steps_20_SWG <- steps_20_SWG %>%
#   mutate(
#     steps_20_SWG_date = as.Date(STUDY_METRIC_MSR_START_DT)
#   )
# # Convert dev_IDs PRTCPT_DVC_ID and STUDY_PRTCPT_ID to a mapping
# device_mapping <- dev_IDs %>%
#   select(PRTCPT_DVC_ID, STUDY_PRTCPT_ID) %>%
#   # If there are duplicates, we might want to take unique combinations
#   distinct()
# 
# # Add the device IDs to date_mapping
# date_mapping[, PRTCPT_DVC_ID := device_mapping$PRTCPT_DVC_ID[match(prtcpt_id, device_mapping$STUDY_PRTCPT_ID)]]
# library(dplyr)
# 
# # Add STUDY_METRIC_MSR_VAL to date_mapping based on matching conditions
# date_mapping <- date_mapping %>%
#   left_join(
#     steps_20_SWG %>% 
#       select(PRTCPT_DVC_ID, steps_20_SWG_date, STUDY_METRIC_MSR_VAL),
#     by = c("PRTCPT_DVC_ID" = "PRTCPT_DVC_ID", "date" = "steps_20_SWG_date")
#   )
# library(dplyr)
# 
# # Create the fitbit_meas column
# date_mapping <- date_mapping %>%
#   mutate(fitbit_meas = !is.na(STUDY_METRIC_MSR_VAL))
# # Create the Xiao data frame by dropping the STUDY_METRIC_MSR_VAL column
# Xiao <- date_mapping %>%
#   select(-STUDY_METRIC_MSR_VAL)
# 
# # Write the Xiao data frame to a CSV file
# write.csv(Xiao, "Xiao.csv", row.names = FALSE)

```



```{r}

```




```{r}
HR_STEPS_filtered_stats_SWG_all_ptcpt <- HR_STEPS_filtered_stats_SWG_all_ptcpt %>%
  left_join(date_mapping, by = c("prtcpt_id", "day"))
```



```{r}
df_MOOD_time <- df_MOOD_time %>% 
  rename(prtcpt_id = STUDY_PRTCPT_ID) %>%
  mutate(Date = as.Date(Date))

HR_STEPS_filtered_stats_SWG_all_ptcpt <- HR_STEPS_filtered_stats_SWG_all_ptcpt %>%
  left_join(
    df_MOOD_time %>% select(prtcpt_id, Date, INT_SRVY_RSPNS),
    by = c("prtcpt_id" = "prtcpt_id", "date" = "Date")
  )
```




There are some rows where the INT_SRVY_RSPNS value is called "SELECTED". I don't know what that means. Will filter it out probably. 

```{r}
HR_STEPS_filtered_stats_SWG_all_ptcpt <- HR_STEPS_filtered_stats_SWG_all_ptcpt %>%
  filter(!(INT_SRVY_RSPNS=="SELECTED"))
```

A large amount of values where "SELECCTED" as shown here. 
> table(df_MOOD_time$INT_SRVY_RSPNS)

       1       10        2        3        4        5        6        7        8        9 SELECTED 
       4       23       19       32       54       89      142      167      167       65      119 
       
So the number of rows in HR_STEPS_filtered_stats_SWG_all_ptcpt drastically. 



Include the demographic data of the group.  

```{r}
library(readxl)
SWG_demo <- read_excel("C:\\Users\\rajnishk\\OneDrive - Michigan Medicine\\Documents\\Analysis_projects_R_laptop\\SWG_R_project\\SWG_data\\Student Wellness Demographics.xlsx")
```



```{r}
filtered_SWG_demo <- SWG_demo %>%
  filter(`Study ID` %in% c("Age", "Female" , "Male" ))
```



```{r}
filtered_SWG_demo_no_identity <- filtered_SWG_demo %>%
  select(-Identity)
```



```{r}
library(tidyr)
transposed_demo <- as.data.frame(t(filtered_SWG_demo_no_identity))
names(transposed_demo) <- transposed_demo[1,]
transposed_demo <- transposed_demo[-1,]
```

Removing the row with "Total" value 

```{r}
transposed_demo <- transposed_demo[-nrow(transposed_demo), ]
```

Add the demographic to the physiological summary data set. 

```{r}
HR_STEPS_filtered_stats_SWG_all_ptcpt <- HR_STEPS_filtered_stats_SWG_all_ptcpt %>%
  rename(MOOD = INT_SRVY_RSPNS) %>%
  mutate(MOOD = as.numeric(MOOD))
```


```{r}
# Step 1: Create a mapping between rm_access_code and study_id
mapping_df <- roadmap_IDs %>%
  select(study_id, rm_access_code)

# Step 2: Convert transposed_demo to a data frame with study_id as a column
transposed_demo_with_id <- transposed_demo %>%
  rownames_to_column('study_id')

# Step 3: Merge mapping with demographic data
demo_with_codes <- mapping_df %>%
  left_join(transposed_demo_with_id, by = "study_id")

# Step 4: Finally, merge with the main dataset using rm_access_code to match with prtcpt_id
HR_STEPS_filtered_stats_SWG_all_ptcpt_with_demo <- HR_STEPS_filtered_stats_SWG_all_ptcpt %>%
  left_join(demo_with_codes %>% 
              select(rm_access_code, Age, Female, Male),
            by = c("prtcpt_id" = "rm_access_code"))
```


```{r}
# Create a new Gender column with FEMALE/MALE labels
HR_STEPS_filtered_stats_SWG_all_ptcpt_with_demo <- HR_STEPS_filtered_stats_SWG_all_ptcpt_with_demo %>%
  mutate(Gender = case_when(
    Female == "x" ~ "FEMALE",    # If Female column has "x", it's FEMALE
    Male == "x" ~ "MALE",        # If Male column has "x", it's MALE
    TRUE ~ NA_character_         # For any other case, set as NA
  )) %>%
  # Remove the old Female and Male columns if desired
  select(-Female, -Male)
```


Rearranging the data frames for a bit. 

```{r}

df_HR_stats_MOOD_demographics <- HR_STEPS_filtered_stats_SWG_all_ptcpt_with_demo %>% 
  select(prtcpt_id, 
         hr_mean_type_4, hr_mean_type_5, hr_mean_type_6, hr_mean_type_7,
         hr_sd_type_4, hr_sd_type_5, hr_sd_type_6, hr_sd_type_7,
         hr_skewness_type_4, hr_skewness_type_5, hr_skewness_type_6, hr_skewness_type_7,
         hr_kurtosis_type_4, hr_kurtosis_type_5, hr_kurtosis_type_6, hr_kurtosis_type_7,
         date, MOOD,Age,Gender)

```

drop the NA values in heart rate

```{r}
print(nrow(df_HR_stats_MOOD_demographics))
df_HR_stats_MOOD__demographic_no_NA <- na.omit(df_HR_stats_MOOD_demographics)
print(nrow(df_HR_stats_MOOD__demographic_no_NA))
```




```{r}
print("scaled data frame with demographics")
df_HR_stats_MOOD__demographics_scaled <- df_HR_stats_MOOD__demographic_no_NA
cols_to_standardize <- setdiff(names(df_HR_stats_MOOD__demographics_scaled), c("prtcpt_id", "MOOD", "date", "Age","Gender"))
df_HR_stats_MOOD__demographics_scaled[cols_to_standardize] <- scale(df_HR_stats_MOOD__demographics_scaled[cols_to_standardize])
head(df_HR_stats_MOOD__demographics_scaled)
```
