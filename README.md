# Student_wellness_group_Wearables_Michigan_Medicine
This is a collection of various implementations of visualizations, cleaning, and analysis of the data sets from the study on the Student Wellness Group at Michigan Medicine. The dataset comprises physiological data from Fitbit, daily self-reported MOOD score, and PROMIS (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System) data from surveys. The physiological data set includes heart rates, activity types, number of steps per minute, and sleep details measured from Fitbit. The data set was downloaded from the Oracle database Roadmap at Michigan Medicine. I used Python and R for these implementations.
