## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

Do some plots for Xiao's paper, or may be just a table is fine. 
```{r}
library(readxl)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(lubridate)
library(Matrix)
library(lme4)
library(lme4)
library(lmerTest)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
df_sleep <-read.csv('C:\\Users\\rajnishk\\OneDrive - Michigan Medicine\\Documents\\Student Wellness Dataset\\student_wellness_sleep_details.csv')
df_MOOD <- read.csv('C:\\Users\\rajnishk\\OneDrive - Michigan Medicine\\Documents\\Student Wellness Dataset\\df_MOOD_SWG.csv')
df_step_20 <- read.csv('C:\\Users/rajnishk/OneDrive - Michigan Medicine/Documents/Student Wellness Dataset/df_step_20.csv')

```

Read the roadmap IDs.
```{r}
df_MOOD_time <- read.csv("C:\\Users\\rajnishk\\OneDrive - Michigan Medicine\\Documents\\Student Wellness Dataset\\SWG_mood_time_entry.csv")
```


```{r}
roadmap_IDs <- read.csv('C:\\Users\\rajnishk\\OneDrive - Michigan Medicine\\Documents\\Dr_Sung_group\\StudentWellness_RoadmapID.csv')
```




```{r}
roadmap_IDs$onboard_date <- as.POSIXct(roadmap_IDs$onboard_date, format = "%m/%d/%y")
df_MOOD$METRIC_START_DATE <- as.POSIXct(df_MOOD$METRIC_START_DATE, format = "%Y-%m-%d")
df_MOOD$METRIC_END_DATE <- as.POSIXct(df_MOOD$METRIC_END_DATE, format = "%Y-%m-%d")
```

Read their Device IDs

```{r}
device_IDs <- read.csv("C:\\Users\\rajnishk\\OneDrive - Michigan Medicine\\Documents\\Student Wellness Dataset\\Device_ID.csv")
device_IDs <- device_IDs[device_IDs$PRTCPT_DVC_TYP_ID == 1,]
```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Don't exclude all the values where MOOD score was not entered. 

Add the columns of day 0 which is the baseline, to day 120, which should be the exit survey day. 

```{r}

# Method 1: Truncate timestamps to dates before calculation
df_MOOD_with_days <- df_MOOD %>%
  left_join(
    roadmap_IDs %>% 
      select(rm_access_code, onboard_date),
    by = c("STUDY_PRTCPT_ID" = "rm_access_code")

    )
  ) # %>%
  # Remove the temporary onboard_date column if you don't need it
  # %>% select(-onboard_date) # There is another 

# Verify the results
# Check a few rows to ensure the calculation is correct
head(df_MOOD_with_days[c("STUDY_PRTCPT_ID", "METRIC_START_DATE", "day_number")], 10)

# Optional: Check if any participants weren't matched
unmatched_participants <- df_MOOD_with_days %>%

  warning("Some participants were not found in roadmap_IDs: ", 
          paste(unmatched_participants, collapse = ", "))
}
